        <h2>JIM CORBETT NATIONAL PARK</h2>
        <p>
            Originally established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, Jim Corbett National Park forms part of the larger Corbett Tiger Reserve, 
            although the names are often used interchangeably.Set in the region of Naintal, Uttarakhand, Corbett is India’s oldest national park, as well as its most prestigious.
             It is naturally one of the most sought-after destinations in India for animal enthusiasts, with over 650 species of wildlife recorded there. 
             Corbett can be explored by Jeep safari, and is also one of the few parks in India that allows visitors to overnight within the park boundaries (in the government-run Dhikala Forest Eco Lodge).
             Corbett National Park was the launching ground for the original Project Tiger, a wildlife conservation program launched in 1973.
             Some of Corbett’s zones are open all year round, and spring is a popular time to visit, with temperatures lower than you’ll encounter across India’s plains.

        <h2>KAZIRANGA NATIONAL PARK</h2>
        <p>
            Established in 1908, Kaziranga is one of the top national parks in Eastern India, famed for its Indian Rhinoceros population.
            This UNESCO World Heritage Site is thought to be home to two-thirds of the world’s Greater One-horned Rhino population. It was also declared a Tiger reserve in 2006, and is currently home to one of the highest densities of Bengal Tigers within a protected area. 
             Kaziranga’s topography is unique and spans the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River, grasslands, forest, and wetlands.
             During some monsoons, Kaziranga has seen extensive flooding, including a major one in 2019. It caused devastation for much of the park’s wildlife, which tried to flee in order to reach higher grounds. 
             Kaziranga has traditionally been explored on Elephant back (which is not considered responsible travel) due to its tall grasses and lack of roads. But these days Jeep safaris are also possible.

        <h2>SNAGARHOLE NATIONAL PARK</h2>
        <p>
            With fewer visitors venturing to southwest India, Nagarhole (which is also written as Nagahole) is something of a hidden ecotourism gem.
            The name originally comes nagarahole, meaning “cobra river” in Kannada, the local language. But don’t worry: The name is in reference to the number of curving streams, rivers, and waterfalls that fill the park than the fearsome reptiles themselves. 
            Nagarhole is a beautiful place that’s widely recognized as one of the best national parks in India. It adjoins the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and forms part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.
            Nagarhole is a sanctuary for Asian Elephants, Leopards, Tigers, Black Panthers, Dholes, Sloth Bears, Crocodiles, and many other creatures, including wide insect biodiversity.
